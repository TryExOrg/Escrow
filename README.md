Tryex is an evolving project that seeks to act as the blockchain intermediary between the user and the CEX. 
The smart contract acts as a temporary holding area where the user deposits funds to be able to trade on the respective CEX. 
At the end of a pre-defined duration or at the close of trade, the CEX can call the funds for reconciliation and closure of books. 
This seeks to provide transparent on chain visibility to the User that his funds are used for the purpose defined. 
The CEX can also at all times view the funds safely stored and continue to provide services commensurate with the funds held.

This method should drastically reduce the need for the User to store funds on CEX unless converting to FIAT. 
CEX usage restricted to On & Off ramp only as there is no requirement of funds storage for trading purposes.
